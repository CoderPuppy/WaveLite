	"editor:open" (editor)
	"editor:close" (editor)

Other stuff

	Here's what needs to be done:
		Up/down needs to work
		Plugins and resources should load with a proper environment.
		Double click and stuff.

		It would be nice to have styles work like this:
		{syntax.Constant.String:"oooh this is an {#Escape;\\'}escaped{#Escape;\\'} string"}
		-> {Constant.String}, {Constant.String.Escape}, {Constant.String}
		You could also implement underlining and bold {@underline:text}, maybe even more later on
		Also maybe {@underline, @bold, syntax:Constant.Keyword;stuff}

		The UI needs work. Add in stuff for adding buttons on the top.
		Add some kind of list framework on the side too.
		Need to add the bar on the bottom. It'll have methods to add stuff to the left/right sides.
		It should space them out evenly and clip middle ones if necessary

		Ctrl-z, Ctrl-y, history, shizzle like that
